# About

This is just a simple project that I made because I wanted to build a neral network from scratch. I was originally planning to use a python library to help with the machine learning aspect of it, but after thinking for a bit, I decided that I would probably learn more if I were to just take and try to build it myself. After doing research (I watched about 2 hours of youtube videos) I had a idea of how I wanted to make it. Unfortunately this AI is not perfect, as the method I used to make it was one that I came up with as I was programming the rules for the game, but the end result did result in a AI that was a lot better then just random placing peaces. As of right now I am not planning on continuing this project and perfecting the AI as I wanted it to be a quick 1-2 day project, and I have already spent about 2 days making it. My end goal of this project was to learn, and I learned a lot, mainly why people use things like Q start instead of just creating there own algorithms and ways of doing things.
